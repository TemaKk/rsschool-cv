3. I don't use "life goals", i dont like them. Just choosing the way to go, the direction of movement, and following them. And this "main" direction is knowledge. Get some experience in what i find inderesting, then then change the area of work, and expand my knowledge further and further. 
To this day i work for about a year for "21vek.by" as an administrator. Job is pretty easy, well paid, and often interesting. Good option for the first "real" job with no need of some special skills.
4. Basic syntax of Python, MySQL and C#.
